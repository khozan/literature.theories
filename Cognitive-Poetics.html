This approach combines elements of cognitive science and linguistics to analyze literary texts, focusing on the cognitive processes involved in reading and interpreting literature.<br>The history of Cognitive Poetics can be traced back to the field of cognitive linguistics, which emerged in the 1970s. Cognitive linguists argued that language and thought are inseparable, and they emphasized the importance of conceptual systems and mental structures in shaping language use. Building on this foundation, Cognitive Poetics seeks to understand how readers make sense of literature and the ways in which literary texts evoke various cognitive responses.<br>One of the key figures in Cognitive Poetics is Reuven Tsur, an Israeli poet and scholar. Tsur's influential book, &quot;Toward a Theory of Cognitive Poetics&quot; (1992), laid the groundwork for this approach. He argued that the study of literature should involve the exploration of readers' mental processes, such as attention, memory, and imagination. Tsur proposed that literary texts manipulate readers' cognitive structures and create new patterns of thought and emotion.<br>Another significant contributor to Cognitive Poetics is David S. Miall, a Canadian scholar. Miall's research focuses on the reader's experience of literature, and he has developed a model of reader response that combines cognitive and affective elements. His work emphasizes the interaction between the reader's personal background, the text, and the context in shaping the interpretation of a literary work.<br>Cognitive Poetics employs various tools and techniques to analyze literature. One central concept is foregrounding, which refers to the manipulation of language and form to draw attention to certain elements of a text. Foregrounding can involve the use of figures of speech, sound patterns, or narrative strategies that disrupt readers' expectations and provoke cognitive engagement.<br>Cognitive Poetics also investigates the role of mental imagery in literary reading. Researchers argue that readers often create vivid mental images while reading, and these mental representations contribute to the aesthetic experience of literature. By studying the use of sensory details, metaphorical language, and narrative descriptions, Cognitive Poetics aims to understand how readers construct mental images and how these images influence their interpretation of a text.<br>In addition, Cognitive Poetics examines the emotional impact of literature and the ways in which literary texts evoke different emotions in readers. This includes analyzing the use of language, rhetorical devices, and narrative techniques to create emotional effects. By studying the relationship between language, cognition, and emotion, Cognitive Poetics provides insights into the affective dimensions of literature.<br>Overall, Cognitive Poetics offers a multidisciplinary approach that combines cognitive science, linguistics, and literary studies. It seeks to understand the cognitive processes involved in reading and interpreting literature, exploring how literary texts shape readers' mental structures, evoke mental imagery, and evoke emotions. This theoretical framework has significantly influenced the study of literature and continues to offer new perspectives on understanding literary texts.<br><strong><br>Example:</strong><br>One example of using Cognitive Poetics (1990s to present) to analyze a poem is by examining the cognitive processes and effects involved in understanding and interpreting the poem's meanings and emotions.<br>In analyzing a poem, we can use Cognitive Poetics to explore how the reader's cognitive abilities, such as perception, memory, and imagination, are engaged in creating meaning from the text. This approach emphasizes the role of mental processes in experiencing and comprehending the poem.<br>For instance, let's analyze the poem &quot;Ode to the Nightingale&quot; by John Keats using Cognitive Poetics:<br>In this poem, Keats expresses his intense longing to escape from the earthly world and its sufferings by immersing himself in the beauty and song of the nightingale. Through the lens of Cognitive Poetics, we can focus on how Keats's language evokes sensory and emotional experiences that engage the reader's cognitive processes.<br>The poem begins with Keats highlighting the contrasting states of joy and melancholy by describing the nightingale's song as &quot;happy, happy&quot; and &quot;plaintive.&quot; This evokes a cognitive contrast that shapes the reader's emotional response and sets the tone for the rest of the poem.<br>Keats then employs vivid sensory imagery to stimulate the reader's perception and imagination. For example, he describes the nightingale's song as a &quot;light-winged Dryad of the trees,&quot; invoking mental images of a graceful, ethereal being. This stimulates the reader's visual and imaginative faculties, enhancing their engagement with the poem.<br>Further, Keats explores the themes of time and mortality, which evoke cognitive processes related to memory and existential contemplation. He acknowledges the transient nature of the nightingale's song, comparing it to &quot;fading, dying&quot; music. This provokes thoughts about the passing of time and the fleeting nature of human experiences, arousing a deeper level of cognitive reflection in the reader.<br>Additionally, the poem's structure and rhyme scheme contribute to its cognitive impact. Keats's use of iambic pentameter and regular rhyme create a rhythmic pattern that engages the reader's cognitive processes, aiding in the comprehension and retention of the poem's meaning.<br>By employing Cognitive Poetics, we can delve into the cognitive aspects of the reader's experience while analyzing a poem. This approach allows us to explore the ways in which language, imagery, themes, and structure interact with the reader's cognitive processes, shaping their understanding, emotions, and interpretations of the poem.<br></span>
