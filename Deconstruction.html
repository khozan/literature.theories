It originated from the work of the French philosopher Jacques Derrida, who challenged traditional literary and philosophical notions by deconstructing them.<br><strong>History:</strong><br>Deconstruction began as a critique of structuralism, a theory that emphasized the existence of universal structures in language, literature, and culture. Jacques Derrida criticized structuralism for disregarding the individual interpretation and multiple meanings that each text could have. He argued that language is inherently unstable and that it is impossible to find a fixed and definitive meaning in any written work.<br><strong>Figures:</strong><br>The main figure associated with deconstruction is Jacques Derrida. He was a French philosopher, known for his influential works such as &quot;Of Grammatology&quot; and &quot;Writing and Difference&quot;. Derrida's ideas challenged the Western philosophical tradition and had a profound impact on literary theory.<br><br><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>Deconstruction aims to expose the underlying assumptions and contradictions present in texts. According to Derrida, every text contains binary oppositions and hierarchical structures that privilege certain meanings over others. Deconstruction seeks to destabilize these hierarchies and reveal the plurality of meanings that coexist within a text.<br>Deconstruction also focuses on the notion of undecidability, which suggests that no concept or meaning can be fully determined or defined. Derrida argued that traditional theories tend to rely on binary oppositions, such as good vs. evil or presence vs. absence. However, deconstruction emphasizes the interplay and inseparability of these opposites, blurring the boundaries between them.<br><br><strong>Key concepts Theories:</strong><br>The main idea behind deconstruction in literature is to challenge the fixed meanings and interpretations that readers often assign to texts. Deconstructionists argue that readers bring their own biases, ideologies, and preconceived notions when interpreting a text. Thus, a text can have multiple interpretations that depend on the reader's perspective and context.<br>Deconstruction also heavily focuses on language and its limitations. Derrida coined the term &quot;diff√©rance&quot; to describe the way language postpones meaning and keeps it in a state of constant deferral. In this view, language is never able to fully capture the essence of what it refers to, and meaning is forever elusive.<br>In summary, deconstruction emerged in the 1980s as a philosophical and literary theory that challenges traditional notions of meaning, interpretation, and language. Jacques Derrida's ideas have had a lasting impact on the field of literary criticism, encouraging readers to question and examine the underlying assumptions and contradictions in texts.<br><br><strong>Examples:</strong><br>The Great Gatsby&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald is one example of using deconstruction to analyze a literary work. This novel, published in the 1920s, can be deconstructed in the context of the 1980s to present, examining the underlying themes and subject matter through a deconstructive lens.<br>Deconstruction, as a literary theory introduced by Jacques Derrida in the 1980s, challenges the notion of fixed meaning and exposes the inherent contradictions and complexities of a text. Applying deconstruction to &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; allows for a deeper analysis of the novel's themes of wealth, love, and the American Dream.<br>In this context, deconstruction would involve examining the various layers of meaning in the text and questioning the assumptions and ideologies that underpin them. For example, the novel portrays the pursuit of wealth and materialism as a central focus for the characters. A deconstructive analysis would question whether this pursuit is truly fulfilling or if it is merely a superficial illusion created by society.<br>Furthermore, deconstruction would also explore the construction of characters in the novel and the power dynamics at play. By examining the contradictions and tensions within the characters' identities and relationships, one can deconstruct the traditional notions of love and desire presented in the text. For instance, deconstruction would challenge the idealized image of Jay Gatsby's love for Daisy Buchanan and question the power dynamics that exist between them.<br>Deconstruction also allows for an exploration of the American Dream in &quot;The Great Gatsby.&quot; This literary theory would unravel the contradictions in the pursuit of the American Dream and expose the underlying social structures that perpetuate inequality and disillusionment. By questioning the idealized vision of wealth and success, deconstruction would reveal the inherent flaws and limitations of the American Dream presented in the novel.<br></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;line-height:17px;">Overall, using deconstruction to analyze &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; in the context of the 1980s to present offers a fresh perspective on the novel's themes and messages. It allows for a critical examination of the text, exposing its complexities, contradictions, and ideologies that may not be evident on the surface.</span>
