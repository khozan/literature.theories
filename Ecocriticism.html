It looks at the relationship between literature and the natural environment, examining how literary works represent and influence human attitudes towards the environment.<br>In the past, environmental concerns were often overlooked or treated as separate from literary analysis. However, the growing awareness of environmental issues in the 20th century led to the development of contemporary environmental movements. Ecocriticism was born out of this context, aiming to bridge the gap between literature and the environment and explore the ecological dimensions of literary texts.<br>One of the key figures in the development of ecocriticism is Lawrence Buell, an American scholar who published the influential book titled &quot;The Environmental Imagination: Thoreau, Nature Writing, and the Formation of American Culture&quot; in 1995. Buell argues that environmental concerns have always been present in literature, but they were not typically analyzed in the context of the natural environment. His book highlighted the importance of reading literature through an ecological lens.<br>Since then, ecocriticism has evolved to encompass a wide range of literary genres and regions, exploring how different writers and cultures engage with the environment. It draws on other theoretical frameworks such as feminism and postcolonialism to analyze the intersections between literature, culture, and environmental issues.<br>In terms of theoretical framework, ecocriticism emphasizes the interconnectedness and interdependence of all living beings and the environment. It seeks to challenge anthropocentric perspectives and promote environmental sustainability. Ecocritics analyze how literary texts portray humans' relationship with nature, examining themes such as environmental degradation, climate change, and the representation of landscapes and animals. They also consider the ethical implications of these portrayals and explore how literature can contribute to environmental activism and awareness.<br>The main goal of ecocriticism is to promote environmental consciousness through literary analysis. It seeks to inspire readers to think critically about their own relationship with the natural world and take action to protect it. By examining literature's representation of the environment, ecocriticism aims to contribute to a more sustainable and ecologically aware society.<br>In conclusion, ecocriticism emerged in the 1990s as a response to the growing environmental concerns of the time. It examines the relationship between literature and the natural environment, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all living beings. Ecocritics analyze how literary texts represent environmental issues and seek to promote environmental consciousness and sustainability.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong><br>One example of using Ecocriticism (1990s to present) to analyze a literary work is by examining the representation of nature and the environment in a novel. In this case, let's consider the novel &quot;The Overstory&quot; by Richard Powers.<br>Ecocriticism, as a literary approach, seeks to understand the relationship between literature and the natural world. It examines how authors portray nature, environmental issues, and the impact of human activities on the environment.<br>In &quot;The Overstory,&quot; Powers explores the interconnectedness between humans and trees through multiple character storylines. Ecocriticism can be employed to deconstruct the novel's portrayal of nature and environmental themes, highlighting the anthropocentric perspective prevalent in the story.<br>The novel demonstrates the significant role trees play in our ecosystem. It emphasizes the intrinsic value of nature and questions human domination over it. Ecocriticism would delve into the author's use of language and imagery to depict the beauty, power, and importance of trees.<br>Moreover, Ecocriticism can examine how the novel addresses broader environmental concerns such as deforestation, climate change, and corporate exploitation of natural resources. It would analyze the characters' interactions with the environment and their impact on ecological systems.<br>Additionally, Ecocriticism would analyze the novel's narrative structure and the representation of non-human entities. In &quot;The Overstory,&quot; trees are depicted as sentient beings with agency and consciousness. This approach would delve into how these representations challenge traditional Western perspectives that prioritize humans over the natural world.<br>Through the lens of Ecocriticism, &quot;The Overstory&quot; can be analyzed as a critique of human-centered thinking and a call for ecological awareness and environmental activism. It prompts readers to reevaluate their relationship with nature and recognize the importance of conservation and sustainability.<br></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;line-height:17px;">In conclusion, Ecocriticism provides a valuable framework for analyzing literature's portrayal of the environment and its impact on human existence. Using this approach, &quot;The Overstory&quot; can be examined for its themes of interconnectedness, environmental issues, and the need for ecological consciousness.</span>
