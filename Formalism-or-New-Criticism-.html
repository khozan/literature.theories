It is a literary theory that focuses on the structure, form, and language of a literary work, rather than its historical or biographical context. Formalist critics believed that a work of art should be analyzed and evaluated based solely on its internal elements and aesthetic qualities.<br>Historically, Formalism was a response to the dominance of Romantic and Victorian literary criticism, which placed a strong emphasis on the author's intention, historical context, and moral messages. Formalists rejected these subjective and external factors and argued for an objective and disinterested analysis of the text itself. They sought to create a scientific and rigorous approach to literary interpretation, drawing inspiration from other disciplines such as linguistics and structuralism.<br>New Critics believed that the meaning of a literary work resides within its own formal elements, such as the use of language, imagery, symbolism, and the organization of plot or structure. They advocated for a close reading of the text, paying attention to details, patterns, and ambiguities in order to grasp its inherent complexity. Formalist critics aimed to identify the internal coherence and unity of a work and to appreciate its artistic qualities.<br><br>The key tenets of Formalism can be summarized as follows:<br>1. Close Reading: Formalist critics engage in close textual analysis, examining the language, structure, and form to decipher meanings and patterns.<br>2. Intentional Fallacy: They reject the idea that the author's intention or biography should determine the interpretation of a text. Instead, meaning should be derived from the text itself.<br>3. Organic Unity: New Critics believe that a work of literature is an organic whole, with each part contributing to its overall meaning and effect. They analyze how the formal elements work together to create a unified artistic experience.<br>4. Ambiguity and Paradox: Formalists appreciate the inherent ambiguity and paradoxes in a literary work. They see these as enriching the complexity and depth of the text.<br>5. Objective Evaluation: Formalist critics aim to provide objective evaluations of a work based on its formal qualities rather than personal preference or preconceived notions about its social or historical significance.<br>6. Defamiliarization: Formalism encourages readers to approach a literary work with a fresh perspective, looking beyond familiar conventions and seeking new ways of seeing and understanding.<br><br>One of the prominent figures associated with Formalism is T.S. Eliot, whose essay &quot;Tradition and the Individual Talent&quot; discusses the concept of the impersonal artist and the importance of tradition in shaping creative works. Other influential Formalist critics include Cleanth Brooks, John Crowe Ransom, and I.A. Richards.<br>Overall, formalism or New Criticism is a literary theory that emerged in the late 19th century and early 20th century as a reaction against subjective and external approaches to literary interpretation. It focuses on the formal elements of a work, emphasizing close reading, organic unity, ambiguity, and objective evaluation. Formalism seeks to understand and appreciate a literary work on its own terms, independent of historical, biographical, or social contexts.<br><strong>Example:<br></strong>Sure! Here's an example of how Formalism or New Criticism can be used to analyze a literary work written in English:<br>Text: &quot;The Waste Land&quot; by T.S. Eliot<br>The Formalist approach to analyzing &quot;The Waste Land&quot; would focus on its formal elements, such as language, structure, symbolism, and imagery, rather than its historical or biographical context.<br>1. Language: A Formalist analysis would closely examine the use of language in the poem, including its syntax, diction, and word choice. Eliot's use of fragmented and disjointed language reflects the fractured and disoriented modern world he portrays. The poem is composed of different voices and perspectives, representing the fragmented nature of society.<br>2. Structure: Formalists would analyze the structure of &quot;The Waste Land&quot; to understand how it contributes to the overall meaning of the poem. The poem is divided into five sections, each with its own distinct style and theme. The fragmented structure mirrors the fragmented society, while the cyclical structure reflects the repetitive and destructive nature of history.<br>3. Symbolism: A Formalist interpretation would explore the symbolism in &quot;The Waste Land&quot; and its contribution to the poem's meaning. For example, the image of the waste land itself symbolizes the barren and desolate state of modern society. The use of mythological and literary references adds layers of meaning and creates connections between past and present.<br>4. Imagery: Formalist critics would pay close attention to the imagery in &quot;The Waste Land&quot; to uncover its significance. Eliot's vivid and often disturbing imagery creates a sense of alienation and decay. The use of contrasting images, such as the beauty of nature juxtaposed with urban decay, highlights the fragmented and contradictory nature of modern life.<br>5. Ambiguity: Formalism appreciates the inherent ambiguity in a literary work. In &quot;The Waste Land,&quot; Eliot intentionally leaves certain aspects open to interpretation, allowing readers to actively engage with the text. Formalist analysis would explore these ambiguities and their potential meanings, emphasizing the complexity and depth of the poem.<br></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;line-height:18px;">Overall, a Formalist analysis of &quot;The Waste Land&quot; would focus on the poem's formal elements, such as language, structure, symbolism, imagery, and ambiguity. By examining these elements closely, Formalist critics aim to appreciate the artistic qualities and internal coherence of the poem, rather than rely on external factors such as historical or biographical context.</span>
