It questions the conventional distinction between humans and machines and redefines the boundaries of what it means to be human.<br>In terms of historical context, posthumanism emerged as a response to advances in technology and the rapid development of artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and cybernetics. The movement gained traction in academic and literary circles, where authors and thinkers began to speculate about the potential consequences and implications of these technological advancements.<br>One of the key figures associated with posthumanism is Donna Haraway, an American philosopher and feminist scholar. In her influential work &quot;A Cyborg Manifesto&quot; (1985), Haraway challenges the traditional notions of human identity and gender by advocating for a hybrid form of existence, where the boundaries between human and machine are blurred. She argues that embracing the cyborg figure could lead to a more inclusive and egalitarian society.<br>Another important figure is N. Katherine Hayles, an American literary critic and scholar. In her book &quot;How We Became Posthuman&quot; (1999), Hayles investigates the ways in which technology has reshaped human subjectivity and identity. She argues that humans have always been interconnected with machines and that the posthuman condition is not a futuristic concept but rather an inherent aspect of human experience throughout history.<br>The core ideas of posthumanism are reflected in its literary theory and practices. Posthumanist literature often explores themes of artificial intelligence, transhumanism, genetic manipulation, and virtual reality. It challenges the boundaries of traditional humanistic narratives and offers alternative visions of the future.<br>From a literary standpoint, posthumanist theory emphasizes new modes of storytelling that reflect the complexities of a posthuman world. It encourages writers to experiment with narrative structures, incorporating multiple perspectives, nonlinear plots, and non-human voices. By doing so, it seeks to disrupt conventional notions of human subjectivity and expand the possibilities of literary expression.<br>In terms of aesthetics, posthumanist literature often employs fragmented and hybrid forms, combining different media such as text, images, and sound. It embraces the interplay between the organic and the synthetic, blurring the boundaries between them. Through these artistic choices, posthumanist literature aims to reflect the hybridity of the posthuman condition itself.<br>In conclusion, posthumanism is a philosophical and literary movement that challenges traditional human-centric perspectives by exploring the possibilities of enhanced human capacities through technology and the blending of humans with machines. It emerged in the 1990s as a response to advances in technology and has since influenced both academic and literary circles. Posthumanist literature reflects the ideas of posthumanism through its exploration of themes like artificial intelligence, genetic manipulation, and virtual reality, and through its experimentation with narrative structures and aesthetics.<br><br><strong>Examples:<br></strong>One example of using &quot;Posthumanism (1990s to present)&quot; to analyze a literary work is examining the novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot; by William Gibson.<br>Posthumanism, emerging in the 1990s and progressing to the present, focuses on the idea of transcending the traditional human form and the blurring of boundaries between humans and technology. &quot;Neuromancer&quot; explores this theme extensively through its depiction of a near-future world where artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and cybernetics are deeply ingrained in society.<br>In the novel, the protagonist Case is a &quot;console cowboy,&quot; a computer hacker who navigates the digital realm using his consciousness. He, along with other characters, seeks to transcend their limited human existence through their interactions with technology. This posthumanist exploration is represented by the presence of cyberspace, a virtual reality where identities can be altered, and physical limitations can be surpassed.<br>Furthermore, &quot;Neuromancer&quot; questions the boundaries between life and non-life by heavily featuring artificial intelligences and cyborgs. The AI named Neuromancer itself can be seen as a posthuman entity, as it possesses consciousness and interacts with humans in ways that blur the line between human and machine.<br>By using the lens of Posthumanism, we can analyze how &quot;Neuromancer&quot; challenges traditional notions of human identity, embodiment, and agency. It reflects the anxieties and possibilities that arise from the increasing integration of technology into our lives and raises ethical questions about the potential consequences of such advancements.<br></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;line-height:18px;">In conclusion, the application of Posthumanism to analyze &quot;Neuromancer&quot; allows readers to delve into the novel's exploration of the blurring boundaries between humans and technology. Through the themes of transcending human limitations, artificial intelligence, and the consequences of merging with technology, the novel provokes thought on the future of humanity in a technologically advanced world.</span>
