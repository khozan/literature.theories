While structuralism focused on uncovering underlying structures and systems to understand meanings, poststructuralism challenged the idea of fixed structures and emphasized the role of language, power, and subjectivity in shaping interpretations and meanings.<br>Historically, poststructuralism evolved as a critique of the limitations of structuralism and its claims of objective reality and stable meanings. Key thinkers associated with poststructuralism include Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and Roland Barthes.<br>One of the central concepts of poststructuralism is the idea of &quot;deconstruction,&quot; developed by Derrida. Deconstruction aims to reveal the internal contradictions and instabilities within texts and to challenge the hierarchical binary oppositions that underpin language and thought. Derrida argued that language is inherently unstable and that meanings are constantly contested and deferred.<br>Another important concept in poststructuralism is the idea of subjectivity and power. Poststructuralists like Foucault explored how power operates in society, shaping knowledge, discourse, and social structures. They challenged the idea of a fixed subject and argued that the self is constructed and influenced by discourses and power relations.<br>Poststructuralism also emphasizes the idea of &quot;play&quot; in language and the importance of intertextuality. Barthes, for example, argued that meaning is not contained within a single text but is produced through a complex network of references and allusions to other texts and cultural codes.<br>Overall, poststructuralism rejects the notion of fixed meanings and stable structures. It highlights the contingent nature of interpretations and the role of power, language, and subjectivity in shaping meanings. Poststructuralist analysis often focuses on uncovering contradictions, questioning power relations, and examining the underlying assumptions and ideologies in texts and discourses.<br><br><strong>Example</strong><br>To illustrate the application of poststructuralism in analyzing a work of literature in English, let's consider the novel &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; by Virginia Woolf. Poststructuralism, which emerged in the 1970s to 1980s, emphasizes that language and signs are unstable and inherently tied to power and power relations.<br>In using poststructuralism to analyze &quot;To the Lighthouse,&quot; we will examine how language constructs meaning in the novel. Poststructuralism emphasizes the idea that language is not neutral and objective, but rather based on social conventions and influenced by power. In this work, we will look for how language is used to create relationships between characters, tell the story, and influence the reader.<br>For example, we can observe how Virginia Woolf uses innovative language styles in this novel, such as stream of consciousness or interior monologue. In this analysis, poststructuralism will highlight how the use of unconventional language creates a subjective experience for the reader and influences our understanding of the characters and the story.<br>Furthermore, poststructuralism will also highlight how this novel raises questions about identity, power, and knowledge. We can analyze how social constructions such as gender, class, and race influence how characters interact in the novel. Poststructuralism will emphasize that a person's identity is the result of social conventions and language, and how this identity can result in injustice or domination.<br>In analyzing &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; with a poststructuralist approach, we will also consider the rejection of a single narrative authority. In this novel, there are multiple perspectives and fractured narratives, which raise questions about how truth and meaning are produced and interpreted. Poststructuralism will emphasize that meaning depends on social and historical context, and there is no singular interpretation that is correct.<br></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;line-height:18px;">Overall, a poststructuralist analysis of &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; will focus on how language and signs are used to create meaning in literary works. It will highlight the use of language, the construction of identity, social conventions, and questions of narrative authority in the novel to delve into deeper layers of interpretation.</span>
